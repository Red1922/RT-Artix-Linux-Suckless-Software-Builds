# RT-Artix-Linux-Suckless-Software-Builds
This repository contains my builds of suckless.org software. These are wholly personalized but can still be used elsewhere. Patches are included in a separate 'Patched' folder inside each software build. I do not use my surf build. It is mainly for experimenting reasons.
