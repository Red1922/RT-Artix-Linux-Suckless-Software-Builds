# RT-Artix-Linux-Suckless-Software-Builds
This repository contains my builds of suckless.org software. These are wholly personalized but can still be used elsewhere. Patches are included in a separate 'Patched' folder inside each software build. I do not use my surf build. It is mainly for experimenting reasons.

# Colour Scheme
You can refer my IInd edition BSPWM configuration to get an idea of the colour scheme there to edit dwm/config.def.h accordingly. I have kept the colour codes there but it is a big mess. I will try to clean it up later when I am free. This is my current WM so changes will be frequent. I will try to add the configuration as soon as possible.
